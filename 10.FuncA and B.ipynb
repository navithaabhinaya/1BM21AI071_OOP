    "program should include the following components:\n",
    "1. Thread Creation:  Create two threads, each responsible for executing a different\n",
    "function concurrently.\n",
    "2. Functionality:  Define two functions, function_A and function_B, where\n",
    "function_A prints numbers from 1 to 5, and function_Bprints\n",
    "letters 'A' to 'E'. Ensure that both functions have a delay between\n",
    "prints to simulate time-consuming tasks.\n",
    "3. Thread Execution:  Start both threads to run concurrently.\n",
    "4. Synchronization:  Implement a mechanism to synchronize the threads so that the\n",
    "numbers and letters are printed in an alternating fashion (e.g., 1,\n",
    "'A', 2, 'B', ...).\n",
    "5. Thread Termination:  Ensure that the program waits for both threads to complete their\n",
